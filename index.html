<h4>1: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/itux">Twitch</a></h4>
  <p>Twitch is a streaming platform where people stream primarily video games.
    What's cool about twitch is it has created communities around video games
    like no other. Being able to watch others play video games whether it be
    friends, family, professionals, or random people is really cool to me</p>

  <p>Spotify has revolutionized the way people listen to music. For a large
    majority of the world spotify provides a seamless way to listen to musicians.

  <p>Robinhood is a website used for buying and selling stocks. Stocks have
    always been an interest of mine growing up, and robinhood has made buying
    and selling stocks more accessible to the general public.</p>
